# Code Review: 14.2-05 - compact_output Mode + Edge-Type Scoring

## 1. Structure Analysis
- [x] Does the change respect the directory structure?
- [x] Is the code modular and well-organized?

## 2. API & Contracts
- [x] Does the change respect existing API contracts?
- [x] Are the new contracts well-defined?

## 3. Dependency Check
- [x] Are there any new dependencies? (None)
- [x] Are there any potential dependency conflicts? (None)

## 4. Engineering Quality
- [x] Is the code idiomatic and well-formatted?
- [x] Are the comments and documentation clear?

## 5. Security Check
- [x] Are there any potential security vulnerabilities? (None)
- [x] Are there any hardcoded secrets or API keys? (None)

## Summary
The implementation adds significant value to context management without breaking existing flows. The temporal decay and edge multipliers use reasonable defaults backed by research. Compact mode effectively reduces data volume for the LLM.
